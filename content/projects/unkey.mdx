Iâ€™m building DIA to make support accessible, safe, and stigma-free for every woman.
DIA is an AI-powered platform designed to provide personalized emotional and legal support for women. By combining AI-driven conversation models with privacy-first design, DIA helps users access confidential guidance, resources, and local helpline information safely.

Built around empathy and accessibility, DIA leverages intelligent summarization, translation, and writing tools to simplify legal information and provide mental wellness support in multiple languages.
Currently in the idea stage, DIA aims to make support systems more inclusive, stigma-free, and easy to reach, especially for women navigating emotional or legal challenges.
