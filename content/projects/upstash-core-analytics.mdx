Fusion Flow (also referred to as Uniflow) is a visual workflow automation tool that empowers users to create, configure, and execute complex workflows through a drag-and-drop interface built with React Flow. It features four core components: User Query (entry point), Knowledge Base (document upload & processing), LLM Engine (AI-powered responses), and Output (interactive chat interface). The platform supports real-time configuration, document processing for PDF, TXT, and DOCX files, and integrates with multiple APIs including OpenAI, Gemini, SerpAPI, and Brave Search.

Built with React 18 + TypeScript + Vite and styled using Tailwind CSS, Fusion Flow leverages React Hooks for state management and Lucide React icons for a clean, modern UI. Itâ€™s ideal for teams or individuals seeking dynamic, AI-driven workflow automation.
